# Strategy and Accuracy Change Log

This is the detailed experiment record for strategy logic, accuracy filters, entry/exit rules, and their configuration. Read it before proposing or making one of these changes. Record every affected file in [DAILY_CHANGELOG.md](DAILY_CHANGELOG.md) as well; use this log for the experiment hypothesis, baseline, and measured outcome.

## Change Rules

- Append a record for every proposed experiment and its outcome. Never rewrite or delete an old record; correct it with a dated follow-up entry.
- Before changing anything, search this log for the same filter, parameter, problem, or hypothesis. Do not repeat a rejected or inconclusive change unless new evidence or a materially different test is recorded.
- Change one strategy or accuracy variable per experiment. Keep unrelated settings and the evaluation method unchanged so the result can be attributed.
- Record the current code/config version and baseline before the change. Compare using the same replay period or comparable paper-trading conditions, including costs where available.
- Collect at least 10 closed paper trades before a strategy decision, as required by `week3_implementation.md`. This is only a minimum screening sample, not proof of an edge. If evidence is insufficient or mixed, keep the result inconclusive and gather more data.
- Never describe a target or hypothesis as an achieved improvement. Keep the prior known-good behavior available so a failed or harmful trial can be reverted.
- Operational, security, or correctness fixes are not held back by this experiment process; test and record them, and keep them distinct from strategy-performance claims.

## Current Baseline

No historical strategy experiments have been reconstructed in this log. Do not infer past outcomes from old plans or projected performance claims. For the next proposed strategy change, capture the actual current code/config version and measured baseline before editing.

## Append-Only Experiment Record

Copy this template for each proposal. Keep the proposal and final outcome together, adding dated follow-up notes rather than replacing the original record.

### EXP-2026-09-30-01
- Status: running; performance outcome is inconclusive until closed paper trades are recorded.
- Problem and evidence: Sept 28-30 archived sessions recorded zero BUY/SELL signals and zero opened trades. Sept 28 and 29 had 11,315 and 10,859 regular-session sideways-regime reason mentions. Sept 30 included repeated 85-point HOLDs citing missing volatility compression and breakout confirmation. Archived histories are truncated to five bars, so they cannot support a valid historical replay.
- Prior related log entries checked: No completed strategy experiment exists in this log; Week 3 guidance says retain safety gates and collect at least 10 closed paper trades before evaluating performance.
- Hypothesis: Promoting an already-scored trend-shadow candidate after all existing context, news, session, accuracy, option, and risk checks may produce a measurable paper sample without weakening those checks or changing live behavior.
- Single variable being changed: Permit validated trend-shadow candidates to enter through the existing order path only when paper mode is enabled and `paper_trade_trend_shadow_signals` is true.
- Code/config before: commit `504b6a4` plus the pre-existing uncommitted shadow instrumentation; `min_entry_score=75`, volatility range `0.05%-5.0%`, `paper_trading_enabled=true`, `live_orders_enabled=false`.
- Baseline period and metrics: Sept 28: 0 directional signals / 0 opened trades; Sept 29: 0 / 0; Sept 30: 0 / 0. The latest 7-day report recorded two closed losses (-₹3,356.75 total), too small to assess an edge.
- Test method and fixed sample: Keep existing filters/risk settings fixed; track the separately labeled paper variant until at least 10 closed trades. Do not infer a trade tomorrow or a performance gain.
- Change made: Opt-in paper-only promotion, source attribution in decision/trade archives, and separate weekly performance aggregation; dated 2026-09-30.
- Results: Pending paper-market observations; no backtest claim because archived histories are truncated.
- Decision: Running as a controlled paper experiment; do not enable for live orders.
- Rollback: Set `paper_trade_trend_shadow_signals` to `false` or revert the promotion change.
- Follow-up: Record closed-trade count, P&L, win rate, and rejection reasons after each session; keep the result inconclusive until the minimum sample is met.

### EXP-2026-09-30-02

- Status: running; performance outcome is inconclusive until closed paper trades are recorded.
- Problem and evidence: The prior paper-only shadow promotion still applies the global 75-point score floor twice, including after promotion, while recent sessions recorded zero opened trades.
- Prior related log entries checked: `EXP-2026-09-30-01`; this changes only the paper-shadow score floor and leaves its other gates unchanged.
- Hypothesis: Lowering only the paper-shadow score floor to 55, matching the scorer's existing minimum for a directional trend candidate, may produce more paper observations while the volatility, confirmation, context, news, session, option, sizing, and daily-loss gates remain active.
- Single variable being changed: `paper_shadow_min_entry_score`, from the primary floor of 75 to 55 for opted-in paper shadow trades only.
- Code/config before: commit `504b6a4` plus the uncommitted trend-shadow experiment; `paper_trading_enabled=true`, `paper_trade_trend_shadow_signals=true`, `live_orders_enabled=false`, and `min_entry_score=75`.
- Baseline period and metrics: Sept 28-30 recorded 0 directional signals / 0 opened trades per session in the prior baseline. Filter-level historical counts for this proposed threshold were not available; recent archived bars are insufficient for a valid historical replay.
- Test method and fixed evaluation period/sample: Keep every non-score gate and risk setting fixed; track separately attributed paper trades and rejection reasons until at least 10 closed paper trades. Do not infer a daily trade or performance gain.
- Change made: Added an opt-in paper-shadow-only score floor set to 55; primary and live score floors remain unchanged, dated 2026-09-30.
- Results: Pending paper-market observations.
- Decision: Running as a controlled paper experiment; do not enable for live orders.
- Rollback: Set `paper_shadow_min_entry_score` to 75 or disable `paper_trade_trend_shadow_signals`.
- Follow-up: Compare trade count, closed-trade P&L, win/loss sizes, and shadow rejection reasons with the prior baseline after each session; keep inconclusive until the minimum sample is met.

### EXP-2026-09-30-03

- Status: running; performance outcome is inconclusive until closed paper trades are recorded.
- Problem and evidence: Sept 29 recorded 10,859 regular-session mentions of the sideways-regime HOLD gate and zero directional signals/trades. The Sept 30 local archive also has zero directional signals/trades but lacks the shadow telemetry fields, so it cannot show whether the prior paper-shadow experiment was active.
- Prior related log entries checked: `EXP-2026-09-30-01` and `EXP-2026-09-30-02`; this experiment changes only whether an opted-in paper shadow candidate is evaluated past the sideways early return.
- Hypothesis: Evaluating directional candidates on sideways bars may increase paper observations while the primary signal remains HOLD and downstream score, context, volatility, confirmation, session, option, sizing, and daily-loss gates remain active.
- Single variable being changed: `paper_shadow_allow_sideways`, false/default-off to true in the paper config; only the shadow path bypasses the early regime return.
- Code/config before: commit `504b6a4` plus the uncommitted paper-shadow score-floor experiment; `paper_trading_enabled=true`, `paper_trade_trend_shadow_signals=true`, `paper_shadow_min_entry_score=55`, and `live_orders_enabled=false`.
- Baseline period and metrics: Sept 29: 0 BUY/SELL, 0 opened trades, and 10,859 sideways reason mentions. Sept 30 local archive: 0 BUY/SELL and 0 closed trades, but no shadow fields. Exact historical candidate counts at the proposed behavior are unavailable.
- Test method and fixed evaluation period/sample: Keep all other settings fixed; compare shadow candidate count, rejection reasons, and separately attributed closed-trade outcomes until at least 10 closed paper trades. Do not infer profitability or guarantee a daily entry.
- Change made: Allow opt-in paper-shadow evaluation past the sideways early return while forcing the primary signal to HOLD; dated 2026-09-30.
- Results: Pending paper-market observations.
- Decision: Running as a controlled paper-only experiment; do not enable for live orders.
- Rollback: Set `paper_shadow_allow_sideways` to `false` or disable `paper_trade_trend_shadow_signals`.
- Follow-up: After each session, inspect the daily review's shadow candidates and rejection reasons before changing any other gate.

### EXP-2026-09-30-04

- Status: proposed; performance outcome is unmeasured until closed paper trades are recorded.
- Problem and evidence: The configured option premium target was 40%, delaying profit protection; the existing staged-target and trailing logic already supports incremental target advances.
- Prior related log entries checked: `EXP-2026-09-30-01`, `EXP-2026-09-30-02`, and `EXP-2026-09-30-03`; no prior option-exit experiment exists.
- Hypothesis: Starting option profit-taking at 20% and retaining staged advances will protect gains earlier while allowing profitable moves to continue through trailing stops.
- Single variable being changed: `option_premium_target_pct`, from 0.40 to 0.20. Normal staged increments remain 0.10 and strong-signal increments remain 0.20.
- Code/config before: `option_premium_target_pct=0.40`, staged targets enabled, trailing enabled, trailing activation ratio 0.5, trailing distance ratio 0.25.
- Baseline period and metrics: No option-specific baseline was measured before this change; performance remains inconclusive until at least 10 closed paper trades are available.
- Test method and fixed evaluation period/sample: Compare option target-stage counts, trailing-stop exits, win/loss sizes, and net P&L over the next 10 closed paper option trades with all other entry and risk settings fixed.
- Change made: Set the initial option target to 20% in the active/example configs and code fallback; dated 2026-09-30.
- Results: Pending paper-market observations.
- Decision: Keep as a paper-only exit experiment; do not claim improved profitability without measured results.
- Rollback: Restore `option_premium_target_pct=0.40` and the corresponding code fallback.
- Follow-up: Review target advances and trailing-stop outcomes after each session.
